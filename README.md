Browser automation CLI built for AI agents. Break through anti-bot walls, hand off to humans across platforms when stuck. Parallel multi-task execution, independent multi-session operation, isolated multi-account browsing.

## Why BrowserAct

AI agents need more than a headless Chrome wrapper — they need a complete browser automation platform:

**Go where standard tools can't — three-layer anti-blocking, progressively escalating:**

1. **Environment layer** — stealth fingerprints, TLS rotation, proxy switching. Most scenarios resolved here without triggering any challenge.
2. **Execution layer** — `solve-captcha` auto-solves common CAPTCHAs; `stealth-extract` pulls protected pages in one command, fully unattended.
3. **Human interaction layer** — `remote-assist` generates a live URL; user opens it on any device to take over. Once done, agent continues seamlessly.

**Concurrent sessions, zero interference:**

- Same-browser multi-session — shared login state, independent execution, tasks don't affect each other *(coming soon)*
- Cross-browser multi-session — different browsers operating simultaneously, fully independent
- Multi-account isolation — each browser has its own fingerprint, proxy, and cookies; websites cannot correlate them

**Isolation: independent identity per browser** — Each stealth browser is a fully independent identity — independent fingerprint, independent proxy, independent cookies. Websites cannot correlate them. Privacy mode further ensures zero residue between sessions.

**Three browser types for different scenarios:**

| Type | Use Case | Key Feature |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `chrome` | Reuse local Chrome logins | Import Profile, run independently |
| `chrome-direct` | Control your running Chrome via CDP | Zero config, full extensions + SSO |
| `stealth` | Anti-detection browsing | Fingerprint spoofing, proxy rotation, batch collection |

All three share the same command interface. Learn one, use all.

**Designed for agents:**

- **Context efficiency** — compact text output, consuming fewer tokens than JSON or HTML
- **Index-based operation** — `state` returns indexed interactive elements; agent operates by index directly, no complex DOM parsing
- **Parallel safety** — session ownership model + explicit naming, no conflicts between multiple agents
- **Complete capabilities** — 50+ commands covering navigation, forms, screenshots, network capture, cookie management

**Security: confirmation gating** — sensitive operations (creating browsers, deletion, importing Profiles) require explicit user approval. No exceptions. Prior approvals do not carry over. Enforced at the Skill layer, not a configuration toggle.

## Install

Tell your AI agent:

> Install browser-act Skill from https://github.com/browser-act/skills/tree/main/browser-act

[Installation details →](docs/installation.md)

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Extract protected page content (zero config)
browser-act stealth-extract https://example.com

# Full browser automation
browser-act --session my-task browser open <id> https://example.com
browser-act --session my-task state          # See clickable elements
browser-act --session my-task click 3        # Click by index
browser-act --session my-task input 2 "hi"   # Type into field
```

[More examples and workflows →](docs/quick-start.md)

The agent runs `get-skills` at the start of each session — gets environment state, browser list, and commands in one call:

```bash
browser-act get-skills core --skill-version 2.0.2
```

[How agents discover and use BrowserAct →](docs/skills.md)

## Also From BrowserAct

### Skill Forge — Generate a Skill for Any Website

Need to extract data from the same website repeatedly at scale? Don't write scrapers by hand. **Skill Forge** explores a site once, discovers its APIs and data patterns, generates a deploy-ready Skill package, then runs reliably without re-exploration — 500 or 5,000 records through the same stable path.

**Any website. Any data. One command to start:**

> Install browser-act-skill-forge Skill from https://github.com/browser-act/skills/tree/main/browser-act-skill-forge

Then tell your agent what you need:

> *"Forge a Skill that extracts job listings from LinkedIn — title, company, salary, URL."*

[Skill Forge documentation →](docs/skill-forge.md)

### Solutions Catalog

30+ pre-built Skills already generated by Skill Forge, ready to install and run. Covers Amazon, Google Maps, YouTube, Reddit, WeChat, Zhihu, and more.

### Build Your Own

Can't find what you need above? Generate a custom Skill for **any website** in minutes — no coding required. Just describe what data you want or what action to perform, and Skill Forge handles the rest.
